# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to properly secure environment variables in the project by ensuring they are not committed to the GitHub repository while maintaining a clear way for developers to understand what environment variables are needed. This will prevent sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets from being exposed in the version control system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that environment variables containing sensitive information are not committed to the GitHub repository, so that I can maintain security of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer adds a .env file to the project THEN the system SHALL NOT commit this file to the GitHub repository
2. WHEN a developer pulls the repository THEN the system SHALL NOT include any actual .env files with sensitive values
3. IF .env files have been previously committed THEN the system SHALL provide a way to remove them from the repository history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a template or example of required environment variables, so that I can easily set up the project locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new developer clones the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a template .env file that can be used as a reference
2. WHEN a developer adds a new environment variable THEN the system SHALL have a process to update the template file
3. IF environment variables differ between environments (development, production, etc.) THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate templates for each environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to ensure that previously committed environment files are properly removed from the repository history, so that sensitive information is not accessible in the commit history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the solution is implemented THEN the system SHALL remove any previously committed .env files from the Git history
2. WHEN a developer views the Git history THEN the system SHALL NOT show the contents of previously committed .env files
3. IF sensitive information was previously committed THEN the system SHALL provide instructions on how to rotate those credentials
